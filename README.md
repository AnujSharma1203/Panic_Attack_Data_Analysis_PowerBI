# Panic Attack Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI project provides an interactive dashboard to analyze panic attack episodes and associated health parameters. It helps in understanding patterns, triggers, and frequency of panic attacks using real-world health data.

The project uses **Snowflake** as the backend database and **SQL queries** for data extraction, sorting, and transformation before visualization.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Explore multiple health indicators associated with panic attacks.
- **Multi-Filters:** Analyze data by symptoms such as:
  - Chest Pain
  - Blood Pressure (BP)
  - Dizziness
  - Sweating
  - Heart Rate
- **Trend Analysis:** Identify patterns over time for individual or combined symptoms.
- **Data Segmentation:** Sort and filter data to analyze high-risk episodes or triggers.
- **Custom Visuals:** Charts and graphs for clear understanding of the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations
- **Snowflake:** Cloud-based database for data storage and management
- **SQL:** Queries for filtering, aggregating, and sorting data for analysis

## Data Workflow
1. Extract data from **Snowflake** using SQL queries.
2. Clean, aggregate, and sort data based on health parameters.
3. Connect Power BI to the processed dataset for visualization.
4. Use filters to explore correlations between symptoms and panic attack episodes.

## Insights
- Identify symptoms that frequently co-occur during panic attacks.
- Monitor trends over time to assess frequency and severity.
- Recognize potential triggers and high-risk conditions for better preventive measures.
